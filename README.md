# Escapade
Escapade is a prototype of a mobile application created for tourists visiting London. This application picks up the location coordinates through a Web API when the user inputs their location. These coordinates then get concatenated to another Web API to fetch the requested information in a tabular format.  We have built a database of users who sign up to this app and recorded their reviews for the places they visit as well as ratings for the application. 

**Application requirements:**
- Python Version: 3.10.4 or above. 
- Required Installations:
    - tabulate : pip install tabulate
    - pandas : pip install pandas
    - numpy: pip install numpy
    - requests: pip install requests
- Please run the Mysql scripts to set up the Escapade Database on your machine and the executable files to see our application in action. 
- To review the application code, follow 'Code_files/main.py'+'Code_files/utils.py'+'Code_files/connect_db.py'+'Code_files/art.py'
- Please refer to the [project brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DviyJKUwoJeGmsbylwu3ILdX-54EoODf9WwZcJABiaM/edit?usp=sharing) to understand the specifications, design and implementation. 

We wish you enjoy your visit to London and Escapade serves you well. 


Team Escapade :)
