# Escapade
Escapade is a prototype of a mobile application created for tourists visiting London. This application picks up the location coordinates through a Web API when the user inputs their location. These coordinates then get concatenated to another Web API to fetch the requested information in a tabular format.  We have built a database of users sign up to this app and recorded their reviews as well as ratings for the places they visit.
