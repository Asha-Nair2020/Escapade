# Escapade
Escapade is a prototype of a mobile application created for tourists visiting London. This application picks up the location coordinates through a Web API when the user inputs their location. These coordinates then get concatenated to another Web API to fetch the requested information in a tabular format.  We have built a database of users who sign up to this app and recorded their reviews as well as ratings for the places they visit. 

Application requirements: 
Python Version: 3.10.4 or above. 
For some functions to work, please install tabulate : pip install tabulate
Please run the Mysql scripts with your password to the database on your machine to see our application working.
